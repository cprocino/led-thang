# pull copter
This on we worked in pairs to creat a small helecotper toy in cad, it work by pulling of a "key" in order to get the "copter" part to spin and create lift.
this was not all to difficult as we were givin each step in order, the difficult part was working together with another person, this was not a problem for me asjosh bleakley worked well together.

### reflection
This wasnt to hard of a project because it wasn't a ton of work of especially difficult.The trick was team work and prexisting cad knowledge.
here is the document we worked on:https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/c21ea5d854d718a86e6eb309/w/f28e1c984dc3fe65682f78f2/e/60f084a7ede173a9bd13a529

# Cylinder 
this was a cad project for which we needed to correctly mesure the mass and other parts of the design. we needed to make it in a way so that we could change dementions of a part and and have it still work.
This required a lot of cad skill and knowledge 
Here are some pictures from various different final pieces

the problems of this for me was mainly procrastination as i had the skills to do every thing but it looked imposing to start. Next time i will just start and go.
# swing arm
this was a CAD assignment that was pretty difficult because not all of the demetions are listed and you need to find them out one at a time and sometime put in a number you know isnt correct.  
Here are some pictures of the project

this one was difficult because it was my first time i had done anything like this and so next time i will be better equiped to handle it. The most important thing is to plan ahead and put time into doing things right in the begging so you dont have problems later on.
